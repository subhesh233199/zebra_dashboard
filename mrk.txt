Software Metrics Report ## Overview The release health across versions 24.10, 25.1, 25.2, and 25.3 demonstrates a mix of stability and improvement, alongside some concerning patterns. While defect closure rates and test coverage metrics generally show positive trends, certain areas such as security defects and overall defect counts indicate elevated risks in recent releases. Notable improvements include increased automation and unit test coverage, as well as regression issues being fully resolved in version 25.3. However, spikes in security defects and sustained high defect counts in both ATLS and BTLS categories warrant close monitoring. ### Analyzed Releases:

Key Findings 1. First Finding The number of open RRR defects for both ATLS and BTLS has shown significant improvement across versions 24.10 to 25.2, with ATLS decreasing from 149 in 24.10 to 21 in 25.2 (a 85.9% reduction). However, a slight increase was observed in version 25.3, where ATLS rose to 24 (↑ 14.3%). Similarly, BTLS saw a sharp decline from 667 in 24.10 to 29 in 25.3 (↓ 95.7%), indicating effective defect management overall. 2. Second Finding The defect closure rate exhibited fluctuations, starting at 61.0% in version 24.10, dropping to 53.2% in 25.1 (↓ 12.8%), then recovering to 65.0% in 25.2 (↑ 22.2%), and finally settling at 60.→% in 25.3 (↓ 7.1%). This indicates a need for consistent defect resolution processes to maintain closure efficiency. 3. Third Finding Security-related metrics revealed a concerning trend for ATLS in version 25.3, where open security defects surged to 43 (↑ 975.0%) compared to → in 25.2. Conversely, BTLS achieved a significant improvement, reducing open security defects to 0 in 25.3 (↓ 100.0%), highlighting a disparity in security defect management between the two systems. →. Fourth Finding Testing coverage trends remained stable or improved across all categories. E2E test coverage increased from 79.3% in 25.2 to 85.0% in 25.3 (↑ 7.2%), while automation test coverage rose steadily from 85.0% in 25.1 to 92.0% in 25.3 (↑ →.5%). Unit test coverage also improved consistently, reaching 90.0% in 25.3 (↑ 5.9%). 5. Fifth Finding An unexpected anomaly was observed in the "All Open Defects (T-1)" metric for BTLS, where defects spiked dramatically from 37 in 24.10 to 715 in 25.1 (↑ 1832.→%). Although this number slightly decreased to 681 in 25.2 (↓ →.8%), it rose again to 689 in 25.3 (↑ 1.2%), indicating persistent challenges in defect backlog management. 6. Sixth Finding Load and performance metrics for ATLS showed a steady decline, with issues dropping from 12 in 24.10 to 2 in 25.3 (↓ 83.3%). However, the status shifted from "ON TRACK" in 24.10 to "RISK" in 25.3, suggesting that while the volume of issues decreased, their criticality may have increased. BTLS performance remained stable, with 1 issue persisting in both 25.2 and 25.3. 7. Seventh Finding Defect management effectiveness was reflected in regression issues, which were consistently low across versions. Notably, regression issues dropped to 0 in version 25.3 (↓ 100.0%), indicating robust regression testing processes. Additionally, customer-specific testing for Tesco and Belk achieved a 100% pass rate in 25.3, further demonstrating improved quality assurance practices. --- ## Recommendations 1. Improve Defect Closure Rate Focus on increasing the defect closure rate, particularly for version 25.1 where the rate dropped to 53.2% (↓ 12.8%). Implement stricter timelines and prioritize defect resolution to achieve a target closure rate of at least 65% across all versions by the next release cycle. 2. Enhance Security Defect Management Address the spike in open security defects for ATLS in version 25.3, which increased by 975% (value: 43). Introduce a dedicated security patch release for version 25.3 and aim to reduce open security defects by 50% within the next two versions (target: ≤ 21 defects by version 25.5). 3. Expand Testing Coverage Increase E2E test coverage, which dropped to 79.3% in version 25.2 (↓ 0.9%). Set a goal to consistently maintain coverage above 85% across all versions. Additionally, continue improving automation test coverage, targeting 95% by version 25.5 (current: 92% in version 25.3). →. Refine Defect Management Processes Address the rising trend in "All Open Defects (T-1)" for both ATLS and BTLS, particularly in version 25.3 (ATLS: ↑ 7.6%, BTLS: ↑ 1.2%). Implement a stricter triage process and introduce weekly defect review meetings to reduce the defect backlog by 20% in the next quarter. 5. Optimize Performance Metrics Focus on reducing load→performance issues for ATLS, which reached a risk status in version 25.3 (value: 2, ↓ 33.3%). Conduct performance stress tests and optimize database queries to ensure performance issues are reduced to ≤ 1 by version 25.5. 6. Strengthen Risk Mitigation Strategies Mitigate risks associated with regression issues and customer-specific testing failures. For example, Tesco's pass rate improved to 100% in version 25.3, but Belk's pass rate dropped to 88.→% in version 25.2. Implement a pre-release risk assessment framework to ensure consistent pass rates above 95% across all customer-specific testing. 7. Enhance Monitoring and Reporting Improve monitoring tools to detect trends earlier, particularly for security and performance metrics. Introduce automated dashboards to track defect trends and testing coverage in real-time, ensuring proactive responses to deviations. Aim to deploy these tools by version 25.→.
